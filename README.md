# Windx
Garmin Connect IQ app for Powered Windx. Windx connect and display wind information using [winds.mobi API](https://winds.mobi/api/2/doc).

# Installation
The app was originally developed for personal use so it is not yet submitted to the Garmin IQ app store. This app is still being tested and should not be used as the primary flight instrument!

To manually install Windx in your device, do the following:

* Connect your device to a computer using a USB cable, the device should appear as a new drive (e.g. D:\ on Windows)
* Download the app binary from your device from the latest [Releases](https://github.com/sreynier-occ/garmin-winds/releases)

* Select the binary for your device type and rename it to Windx.prg
* Copy the app binary to the D:\GARMIN\APPS directory of your device (adjust drive letter as needed)
* Eject the drive, don't just unplug the device

The app should appear in the list of Connect IQ apps or activities menu. If you can't find your device in the releases, you can either compile it yourself using the Garmin IQ SDK or submit an issue.
